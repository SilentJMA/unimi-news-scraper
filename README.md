# Unimi News Scraper
Generate RSS feeds about university news and job posts by scraping the website of the University of Milan.

The following generated feeds can be read with any RSS reader:
- Notice board (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§): [`news_en.xml`](https://github.com/liggiorgio/unimi-news-scraper/blob/master/news_en.xml)
- Notice board (ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹): [`news_it.xml`](https://github.com/liggiorgio/unimi-news-scraper/blob/master/news_it.xml)
- On-campus student work announcements (ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ only): [`news_jobs.xml`](https://github.com/liggiorgio/unimi-news-scraper/blob/master/news_jobs.xml)

The feeds are mainly used along with a Telegram bot to publish new entries as a message in the following Telegram channels:
- Notice board (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§): [Notice board | Unimi (@uniminews)](https://t.me/uniminews)
- Notice board (ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹): [Tutti gli avvisi | Unimi (@avvisiunimi)](https://t.me/avvisiunimi)
